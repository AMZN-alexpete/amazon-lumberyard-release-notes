# Contributing to the Lumberyard Public Release Notes

The Amazon Lumberyard (beta) Release Notes are formed and managed on Github in this repo (https://github.com/awsdocs/amazon-lumberyard-release-notes). Release Notes for the coming version are in a formative state and are provided as early information as to the state of the release; they do **not** represent a commitment for delivery in the final release version. We develop these in public to give customers an early look into what we know about a coming release and to centralize our Release Notes development process. 

All past Release Notes are archived here as well.

Anyone can contribute to these Release Notes with a pull request.  The Amazon Lumberyard Docs Team will review all PRs within 5 business days of submission. Amazon Lumberyard reserves the right to reject any Release Notes contribution for any reason.

You can also provide feedback by submitting Issues. As with PRs, we will respond to PRs within 5 business days of submission. We invite you to use this repo as a formal channel of communication with the Lumberyard team around releases.

## Lumberyard Public Release Notes Structure

The Release Notes are structured under two folders:
  - '/coming-release' -- this contains the developing Release Notes for the **next** release. 
  - '/archive' -- this contains an archive of prior publically sourced Release Notes, organized by release version number. (For example, '/archive/1.21'.)

Under the '/coming-release' folder or a version-numbered folder under '/archive', you'll find 4 MarkDown files:
  - 'index.md': 
  - 'fixes.md':
  - 'chamges-improvements.md':
  - 'known-issues.md':
